As you already know, a relative layout allows you to position views relative to the parent layout, or relative to other views in the layout.

The *xmlns:android* attribute is used to specify the Android namespace, and you must always set it to "http://schemas. android.com/apk/res/android". 

The *android:layout_width* and *android:layout_height* attributes specify how wide and high you want the layout to be. 

You can set android:layout_width and android:layout_height to "match_parent", "wrap_content" or a specific size such as 10dp - 10 density-independent pixels.

"wrap_content" means that you want the layout to be just big enough to hold all of the views inside it, and "match_parent" means that you want the layout to be as big as its parentâ€”in this case, as big as the device screen minus any padding. 

You will usually set the layout width and height to "match_parent".
