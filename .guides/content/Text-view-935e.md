### Used for:
displaying text (whoo hoo)

### Defining in XML
You define a text view in your layout using the 
**< TextView>** element. You use **android:text** to say what text you want it to display, usually by using a string resource:

The TextView API includes many attributes to control the text viewâ€™s appearance, such as the text size. To change the text size, you use the android:textSize attribute like this:
```
android:textSize="14sp"
```
You specify the text size using **scale-independent pixels (sp)**. Scale-independent pixels take into account whether users want to use large fonts on their devices. A text size of 14sp will be physically larger on a device configured to use large fonts than on a device configured to use small fonts.
