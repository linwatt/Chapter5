You may have noticed that all layout types have attributes in common. Whichever type of layout you use, you must specify the layout height and width using the  **android:layout_height** and **android:layout_width** attributes.

The same is true for GUI Components, where it is mandatory to set the height and width using **android:layout_height** and **android:layout_width**

This is because **all layouts and GUI Components are subclasses of the Android View class**
