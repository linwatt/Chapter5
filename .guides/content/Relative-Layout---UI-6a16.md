A **relative layout** displays its views in relative positions. You define the position of each view relative to other views in the layout, or relative to its parent layout. 

As an example, you can choose to position a text view relative to the top of the parent layout, a spinner underneath the text view, and a button relative to the bottom of the parent layout.
