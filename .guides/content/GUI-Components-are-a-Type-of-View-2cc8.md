GUI components are all types of views—behind the scenes, they are all subclasses of the **android.view.View class**. 


This means that all of the GUI components you use in your user interface have attributes and behavior in common. They can all be displayed on the screen, for instance, and they can say how tall or wide they should be. Each of the GUI components you use in your user interface take this basic functionality, and extend it.
