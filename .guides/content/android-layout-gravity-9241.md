The **android:layout_gravity attribute** lets you specify where you want a view in a linear layout to appear in its enclosing space. android:gravity relates to the **contents** of the view, and android:layout_gravity relates to the **view itself**. 

You can use it to push a view to the right, for instance, or center the view horizontally. To move our button to the right, we’d need to add the following to the button:
```
android:layout_gravity="right"
```
