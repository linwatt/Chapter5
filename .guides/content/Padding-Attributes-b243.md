These attributes tell Android how much padding you want between each of the layout’s sides and its parent. Here’s how you would tell Android you want to add padding of 16dp around all edges of the layout:

Some devices create very sharp images by using very tiny pixels. Other devices are cheaper to produce because they have fewer, larger pixels. You use **density-independent pixels (dp)** to avoid creating interfaces that are overly small on some devices, and overly large on others. A measurement in density-independent pixels is roughly the same size across all devices.
